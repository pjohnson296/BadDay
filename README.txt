Welcome to Rant, the Bad Day app! After the initial screen has minimized itself, you will be presented with a screen that allows you to "Let it out." Now click the record button in the middle of the screen and begin recording your rant. Click it again to stop your recording, and you will be brought to the next page of the app. Here you will see a scale from one to ten depicting how angry you were during your rant. Below the scale, you will be faced with a couple options. If you would like to listen to your rant, you can play it either using the play button under the scale or you can access the archive through the "safe" located in the upper right corner, where your rant has been saved for playback. If you decide you've heard enough, hit the stop play button to stop the playback. If you are inside the archive, you can use the device's back button to return to the second screen and choose other options, such as share, incerate, and get over it. If you would like to share your rant to your friends, click on the share button and you will be presented with all of the options your device has available for sharing.Use the devices back button to go back to pages to the "SecondActivity" screen, and now select the "Get Over It!" button in the bottom right of your screen. Notice that there is still the option to view your archive in the top right of the screen. On the "Get Over It!" page you can see you have four options, you can rant again, search for food places in the area, listen to music, or watch/read some funny pick-me-ups in the smile portion. In the future, we hope to add a google maps connection for the food page, a spotify connection for the listen page, and a collection of YouTube videos and funny memes on the smile page. Since these connections are not yet available, you will see "coming soon" buttons that are not accessible. If you wish to return to the second page, you can once again use the device's back button to see the other options one more time. If you decide you are over whatever upset you in the first place, you are to ride your rant from the world using the incinerate button. In the future, we will be adding a fire animation after the confirm button has been pressed so you can literally watch your rant burn. For now, however, you will be brought to the "Get Over It!" page after confirming the delete where you can continue through the app. And that is Rant, the Bad Day app! We hope you find it as useful as we have and that all your bad days can be improved just by knowing that Rant is always available to listen.
