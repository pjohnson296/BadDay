Welcome to the Rant app! Click the opening screen to move on to the rest of the app. Now click the record button in the middle of the screen to begin recording your rant. Click it again to stop your recording, and you will be brought to the next page of the app. Here, click the fancy button in the top left of the screen to playback your rant. If you decide you've heard enough, hit the stop play button to stop the playback. Click on the share button, and a pop up from the bottom appears (in this case, it just switches to a new page). Click the "archive" button in the upper right of your screen to view  your archive of past rants. Use the devices back button to go back to pages to the "SecondActivity" screen, and now select the "Get Over It!" button in the bottom right of your screen. Notice that there is still the option to view your archive in the top right of the screen, but now click the "Eat" button, and you will be brought to a page that shows food options in the area (assuming you like Gusto Pizza). In the future, from the "Get Over It" options page, there will be similar screens when you select "smile" and "listen", but we do not have the visuals for those pages yet. You could also select to go back and rant again!
